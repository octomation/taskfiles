## 💡 Idea

Build and provide template-specific Taskfile to complement its Makefile.

## 🏆 Motivation

Sometimes writing a Makefile is difficult and not always possible.

## 🤼‍♂️ How to

1. [Install `maintainer` tool][maintainer].
2. Create your own Taskfile based on pieces from the `src`.
3. Add `alias run=./Taskfile`.
4. Execute the `run` command.
5. See the `dist` directory.
6. Take profit.

## 🤲 Outputs & outcomes
